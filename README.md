## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware is a supplier of computer hardware and peripherals across India. One of its major clients is **Excel Stores**, a retail chain with operations throughout the country. The company operates through its headquarters in Delhi and regional offices in various parts of India.

The **Sales Director**, Bhavin Patel, faced challenges in managing sales in a rapidly growing market. Key issues included:

- Lack of actionable and transparent sales insights.
- Dependence on subjective verbal updates from Regional Managers.
- Overwhelming data presented through large Excel spreadsheets, making it difficult to identify critical focus areas.

To address these challenges, a reliable **Power BI dashboard** was developed to present key metrics like:

- Revenue trends
- Customer insights
- Regional performance

This solution ensures that Bhavin can make data-driven decisions efficiently, without relying on verbal reports or manually reviewing spreadsheets.
